The main purpose of this project is to compare the different machine learning models to learn which one is the best for predicting a stroke
The dataset used was from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
This was cleaned and preprocessed using R. The R script can be found under "Dataset Preprocessing (2)".
The cleaned dataset can be found as the "data_stroke_undersampled" CSV file
Each Jupyter notebook containes different machine learning models and visualization techniques for the processed dataset.
Each of them are under the name of the team member that used and coded them.
