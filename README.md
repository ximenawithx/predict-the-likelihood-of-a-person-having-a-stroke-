The main purpose of this project is to compare the different machine learning models to learn which one is the best for predicting a stroke.
The dataset used was from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
This was cleaned and preprocessed using R. The R script can be found under "Dataset Preprocessing (2)".
The cleaned dataset can be found as the "data_stroke_undersampled" CSV file.
Each Jupyter notebook containes different machine learning models and visualization techniques for the processed dataset.
Each of them are under the name of the team member that used and coded them.
Some files might not show a preview due to the size of them, such as one of the Jupyter notebooks. The file "6509217 SyedaFizzaRaza.ipynb" does not render as it is big and takes time. It can be viewed and rendered instead in NBviewer by passing the files github URL which is https://github.com/ximenawithx/predict-the-likelihood-of-a-person-having-a-stroke-/blob/12e86401541f287e66a91cd20f10f4cf6e1db104/6509217%20SyedaFizzaRaza.ipynb and pasting it in the nbviewer -->  https://nbviewer.org/
